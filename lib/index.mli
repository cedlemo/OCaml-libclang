 * \brief Provides a shared context for creating translation units.
 *
 * It provides two options:
 *
 * - excludeDeclarationsFromPCH: When non-zero, allows enumeration of "local"
 * declarations (when loading any new translation units). A "local" declaration
 * is one that belongs in the translation unit itself and not in a precompiled
 * header that was used by the translation unit. If zero, all declarations
 * will be enumerated.
 *
 * Here is an example:
 *
 * \code
 *   // excludeDeclsFromPCH = 1, displayDiagnostics=1
 *   Idx = clang_createIndex(1, 1);
 *
 *   // IndexTest.pch was produced with the following command:
 *   // "clang -x c IndexTest.h -emit-ast -o IndexTest.pch"
 *   TU = clang_createTranslationUnit(Idx, "IndexTest.pch");
 *
 *   // This will load all the symbols from 'IndexTest.pch'
 *   clang_visitChildren(clang_getTranslationUnitCursor(TU),
 *                       TranslationUnitVisitor, 0);
 *   clang_disposeTranslationUnit(TU);
 *
 *   // This will load all the symbols from 'IndexTest.c', excluding symbols
 *   // from 'IndexTest.pch'.
 *   char *args[] = { "-Xclang", "-include-pch=IndexTest.pch" };
 *   TU = clang_createTranslationUnitFromSourceFile(Idx, "IndexTest.c", 2, args,
 *                                                  0, 0);
 *   clang_visitChildren(clang_getTranslationUnitCursor(TU),
 *                       TranslationUnitVisitor, 0);
 *   clang_disposeTranslationUnit(TU);
 * \endcode
 *
 * This process of creating the 'pch', loading it separately, and using it (via
 * -include-pch) allows 'excludeDeclsFromPCH' to remove redundant callbacks
 * (which gives the indexer the same performance benefit as the compiler).
